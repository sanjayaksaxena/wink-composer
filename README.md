We are excited to announce the **beginning** of our Generative AI journey to deliver a mature framework designed to simplify LLM application development. Stay tuned as wink-composer unfolds over the next several weeks.

## What is wink-composer?

Wink-composer is an **upcoming open-source JavaScript library** that aims to **simplify** the creation of LLM-driven applications. It will be capable of running on both Node.js and browser environments, with planned support for TypeScript. With its declarative and intuitive API, wink-composer will empower developers to build robust and efficient applications with ease.

### Why wink-composer?
Building on the success and insights gained from our flagship product **[winkNLP](https://github.com/winkjs/wink-nlp)**, we are developing wink-composer to be even more developer-friendly and powerful. Here‚Äôs what will make wink-composer special:

<table>
<tr><td width="330px;">‚ú® Declarative, natural language like API </td><td>Achieve more with minimal code using our intuitive and expressive API.</td></tr>
<tr><td>üîñ Advanced Prompt Templates</td><td>Easily create reusable prompt templates including meta templates at central open source repository.</td></tr>
<tr><td>‚ö°Ô∏è Versatility</td><td>From RAG to information extraction, Q&A, chatbots, data analysis or talking to your data, wink-composer supports a wide range of applications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive Toolset</td><td>Leverage powerful tools for building agents, transforming data with parsers for downstream pipelines, and simplifying data preprocessing and analysis for JSON and CSV formats.</td></tr>
