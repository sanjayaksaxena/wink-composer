We are excited to begin our Generative AI journey, introducing a robust framework that delivers real-time actionable insights from streaming data through contextual ontologies and LLM-driven reasoning. Keep an eye out as winkComposer unfolds over time.

## What is wink-composer?

**WinkComposer** is an **upcoming open-source JavaScript analytics platform** that transforms streaming data into real-time actionable insights. It enables the creation of domain-specific ontologies to provide precise context for data streams. Using statistical and machine learning algorithms, it rapidly detects patterns, identifies anomalies, and intelligently aggregates data. A knowledge graph links business objects, patterns, and events, creating a unified network—ideal for scenarios like monitoring manufacturing in an IoT ecosystem.

WinkComposer leverages an ontology-driven, LLM-powered reasoning framework to analyze events, patterns, and data, uncover root causes, and deliver actionable recommendations. This supports near real-time insights, enabling faster, smarter decisions. Additionally, it helps support teams resolve issues quickly and accelerates onboarding with contextual learning for new team members.
	

### Our Focus
1. **Ease of Use**: Focus on your application logic without worrying about underlying complexities.
1. **Open Source/Weight LLMs**: Prioritizing open-source and efficient LLMs to empower developers.
2. **Extensibility**: Create a modular and loosely coupled framework that simplifies the process for potential contributors to understand and add new features and capabilities.
3. **Safety & Security**: Uphold responsible AI practices and framework security through compliance with OpenSSF standards.

## Contributions are welcome
